Instructions on How to Run Our Program:
Step 1: Clone the repository.
Step 2: Open it with a python IDE of your choice (example: PyCharm)
Note: Don't use Jupyter Notebook since we haven't written it with Jupyter Notebook.
Step 3: Run the different .py files in order to see the different parts of the project.

inputPuzzle.py takes the puzzles from a .txt file and transforms them into a dictionary format which is then used by the other parts of the program.
